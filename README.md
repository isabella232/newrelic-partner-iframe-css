This styles the default New Relic partner iframe to look like the example images below

How To Use This
===============
This provides a sandbox for styling the New Relic partner iframe.
In production, only the CSS is maleable. We've provided the HTML so you can see how your changes will look in production
Once you're happy with how it looks, you most upload the completed CSS to a world-readable location, and then tell the partner iframe to reference that location in the partner admin dashboard

Happy editing!
